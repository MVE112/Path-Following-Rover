# Errors
The rover could do the 90 degree turn around 70-80% of the time however when it couldnt it would start turning the opposite direction. Might have to do with position of IPS or not enough fix in the code. 
The gun also did not hit the targets 100% of the time however issue was more with power distrubition

# Updates in the future
Fixing the 90 degree turn, increasing the PWM, and better power distribution will be the only things left to update to make the rover work 100% of the time with almost no issues.
